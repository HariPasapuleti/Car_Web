        Maserati is an Italian luxury car manufacturer known for producing 
        high-performance sports cars, luxury sedans, and SUVs. 
        Some notable Maserati models include the GranTurismo, Quattroporte, Levante, 
        and the MC20, which is a mid-engine sports car introduced in 2020. Maserati 
        vehicles are known for their distinctive design, powerful engines, and a 
        focus on delivering a refined driving experience.
        Designed to excite the senses in every detail the MC20 Cielo delivers an 
        unrivalled experience. With uncompromised performance, it is time to enjoy 
        the duality of two worlds; being able to see more when the roof is retracted 
        and enjoying the same acceleration, power and driving dynamics as its twin - 
        the MC20 Coupe.
        Dramatic effect doesn't stop when the MC20 Cielo stands still. While 
        remaining a spyder in the purest sense, the doors shift upwards and 
        outwards towards the sky as they open. Without compromising weight or 
        performance, every arrival is an event.
